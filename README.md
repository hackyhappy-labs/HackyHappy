## 🚀“One-click launcher for a Groq-powered RAG AI stack with Docker, Ollama, and OpenWebUI” 

This project provides an **all-in-one auto-run script** that sets up and starts
a complete **Groq-based RAG AI environment**.

With a single script, it will:
- Start Docker services
- Launch Qdrant (vector database)
- Connect Ollama for model management
- Configure Groq-based RAG
- Run OpenWebUI automatically

No manual Docker or service setup is required.
